Demo Highlights:

- Grant access rights to digital content   
- Transfer ownership of digital contract (Land Title in this demo)
- An order of magnitude faster than vanilla ethereum (using [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/) consensus engine).
- Decentralised solution using a folk of [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) for the secure storage of smart contract state information.
- Compatible with any Turing Complete blockchain (e.g. [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/), [Hyperledger](https://www.hyperledger.org/)). Decoupled and modular design.
- Multi user/role security model capabilities.
